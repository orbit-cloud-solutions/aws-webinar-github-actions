Not long ago, the software-development world offered two sharply distinct models: open source and proprietary. Open-source software benefited from its trademark openness: anyone is allowed to offer contributions, so many people do. Proprietary software, on the other hand, limits access via a closed system that prizes the privacy of its intellectual property (IP).

Your company developed a great respect for the patterns used in open source, such as source-code visibility, project bug awareness, and feature request transparency. You also like the pull-request model that simplifies the integration of external contributions. You'd really like to bring those benefits to your development teams, but don't want to open source the company's valuable software. What you really need is a hybrid that delivers the advantages of both approaches.

## Essentials

__InnerSource__ is the practice of applying open-source patterns to projects with a limited audience. For example, a company might establish an InnerSource program that mirrors the structure of a typical open-source project, except that it's only accessible to the employees of that company. In effect, it's an open-source program behind your company's firewall.

Benefits:

- encourage transparency
- reduce friction
- standardize practices
